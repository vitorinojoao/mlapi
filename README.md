# Machine Learning API

A template of a secure Application Programming Interface for Machine Learning models.  
Copyright (c) 2024 Jo√£o Vitorino  

## File Structure

To deploy ML models in a web server and securely access their predictions,  
you can use this template and improve the API to better suit your needs.  

The `application.py` is the main Python file with the creation of a Flask application,  
the initialization of several singleton objects, and the setup of the routes of the API.  

The template is divided into three folders:

- **mlapi** - the entire Python code of the API with useful comments (e.g., routes and objects).
- **resources** - the resources required for the API to work properly (e.g., models and encodings).
- **files** - supplementary files to help you interact with the API (e.g., commands and requests).

## Important Notes

&rarr; **The run.py CLI command starts a development server!**  
The `run.py` file can be used for a development server and also for the entry point of a production server.  
You should check the commands in `CLIrun.txt`.  
For production, you should use HTTPS with a valid TLS certificate and Nginx or a similar proxy server.  

&rarr; **A daemon service automatically starts the server!**  
The `mlapidaemon.service` file can be used to run the server at boot and automatically restart it.  
You should check the commands in `CLIdaemon.txt`.  
It has missing information that must be specified according to the characteristics of your system.  

&rarr; **An API is only as secure as its authorization scheme!**  
A JWT authorization scheme with RSA signatures is implemented, but it must be used properly.  
You should ensure that every route requires an Authorization header and verifies the access tokens.  
After an initial request to `/auth/reset/`, the refresh tokens can be used at `/auth/refresh/` to renew access.

## Sample Code

&rarr; **How to preprocess the JSON body of a request?**  
A 2D input array can be created, converting categorical features into numerical encodings.  
You can use and improve the code of `data_preprocessor.py`.  

&rarr; **How to load and use an ML model in an efficient way?**  
A model can be wrapped in a single object that is used to respond to every request.  
You can use and improve the code of `model_wrapper.py`.  

&rarr; **How to postprocess the anomaly or class predictions?**  
A 1D output array can be created, converting anomaly scores or confidence scores to labels.  
You can use and improve the code of `data_postprocessor.py`.  

&rarr; **How to send multiple requests to different routes?**  
Several GET and POST requests can be sent for the routes of `/auth/` and `/api/`.  
You can use `mlapirequests.postman_collection.json`.
