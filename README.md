# Machine Learning API

A template of a secure Application Programming Interface for Machine Learning models.  
Copyright (c) 2024 Jo√£o Vitorino  

## File Structure

To deploy ML models in a web server and securely access their predictions,  
you can use this template and improve the API to better suit your needs.  

The `application.py` is the main Python file with the creation of a Flask application,  
the initialization of several singleton objects, and the setup of the routes of the API.  

The template is divided into three folders:

- **mlapi** - the entire Python code of the API with useful comments (e.g., routes and singletons).
- **resources** - the resources required for the API to work properly (e.g., models and encodings).
- **files** - supplementary files to help you interact with the API (e.g., requests and tokens).

## Important Notes

&rarr; **The run.py CLI command starts a development server!**  
The `run.py` file can be used for a development server and also for the entry point of a production server.  
You should check the commands in `CLIrun.txt`.  
For production, you should use HTTPS with a valid TLS certificate and Nginx or a similar proxy server.  

&rarr; **A daemon service automatically starts the server!**  
The `mlapidaemon.service` file can be used to run the server at boot and automatically restart it.  
You should check the commands in `CLIdaemon.txt`.  
It has missing information that must be specified according to the characteristics of your system.  

&rarr; **The auth.py CLI command generates a signed access token!**  
The `auth.py` file can be used to generate signed tokens for a JWT authorization scheme.  
You should check the commands in `CLIauth.txt`.  
Each token should be shared with only one client to enable temporary access to the API.  

&rarr; **An API is only as secure as its authorization scheme!**  
A scalable and secure scheme with RSA signatures is implemented, but it must be used properly.  
You should ensure that every route requires an Authorization header and verifies the access tokens.  
The `auth_public_key.pem` file may be shared to enable external verification of RSA signatures.  
Do not share the `auth_private_key.pem` file nor the secret string used for its keyfile encryption.  

## Sample Code

&rarr; **How to preprocess the JSON body of a request?**  
A 2D input array can be created, converting categorical features into numerical encodings.  
You can use and improve the code of `data_preprocessor.py`.  

&rarr; **How to load and use an ML model in an efficient way?**  
A model can be wrapped in a singleton object that is used to respond to every request.  
You can use and improve the code of `model_wrapper.py`.  

&rarr; **How to postprocess the anomaly or class predictions?**  
A 1D output array can be created, converting anomaly scores or confidence scores to labels.  
You can use and improve the code of `data_postprocessor.py`.  

&rarr; **How to send multiple requests to different routes?**  
Several GET and POST requests can be sent, in addition to a general health check.  
You can use `mlapirequests.postman_collection.json`.
